I bought myself [_Fitbit Flex_](http://www.fitbit.com/uk) as a Christmas gift. It was on the top of my wishing list. I was planning to wait _Fitbit Force_ which might be released in the next few months. However, after reading the reviews on Amazon US, I decided to buy _Flex_ instead. 

I have used it for nearly a week. Really enjoyed it so far.

__Motivation__

I walked more than usual this week. I went to City Centre on foot twice in order to achieve everyday goal set on this tiny device. 

__Battery__

I haven't charged it for almost one week. Impressed.

__Steps Count__

Unlike the traditional step counter, _Flex_ is with you all the time. You can also track the progress by simply tap it twice.   

__Sleep Tracking__

Another feature I liked is sleep tracking. Tap it rapidly to step into sleep model. It will record the time of restless and awake, as well as the sleeping hour.

__Alarm__

It will vibrates at the time you set on the iPhone.

__Sync__

Sync smoothly with my iPhone through Bluetooth. So I am able to see the realtime data of steps, distance, calories burned, active minutes etc. 

__Water Proof__

You can used it in the shower or in the rain in theory. I have never tried this though.

__Third Party App__

Several fitness apps support it. 

__Downsides__

* Have to log food eaten by myself. So I just ignore this.

* Not be able to track other activities like cycling.

* Will get some _'bonus'_ steps since it's wrist-based.

* No altimeter. 


_Overall_, I highly recommend it.

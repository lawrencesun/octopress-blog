<p>I spent a wonderful weekend here in Manchester ---- nice food and 10+ cups of coffee throughout the day, 4 or 5 bottles of beer at night ... sounds nice, innit?</p>

<p>Plus, I learned quite a lot about lean startup.</p>

<p>One year ago, I got some vague ideas of lean startup from <a href="http://steveblank.com/">Steve Blank</a>'s online course. I haven't complete that course and haven't read the famous <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">lean startup book</a>. But after reading plenty of 'inspiring' posts and quotes like 'Get off your office', I felt exciting, wanted to 'Follow your heart', quit job and Rock...</p>

<p>Then I found that I didn't know how to implement. First of all, talking to customers was not that easy. I didn't know who to talk, what to talk and how to talk. Secondly, what the hell is MVP? Is it a paper scratch, a website...? Besides, I didn't have confidence of my skills and ideas. So few weeks later, I lose my enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.leanconf.co.uk/">LeanConf</a> from the <a href="https://www.startupdigest.com/‎">startupdigest</a> in late summer. I thought it will be beneficial for me to meet up similar mind guys and learn from the (un)successful founders. And it would be held in Manchester thanks to Ben<strong> </strong>@benaldred and Manuel<strong> </strong>@Digital_tonic. In addition, it offered 2 for 1 tickets including <a href="http://manchester.startupweekend.org/">startup weekend</a>.</p>

<p>So I attended this conference which was amazing. Tomorrow I will write what I learned from it.</p>

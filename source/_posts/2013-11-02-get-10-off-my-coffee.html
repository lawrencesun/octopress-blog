<p>I couldn't believe I finally went into Starbucks and asked for 10% off my medium latte.</p>

<p>I haven't asked for discount in my life before today. Even I was overcharged, I rarely argued that.</p>

<p>"Can I get 10% off ? " I asked the staff with (disinclined) smile.</p>

<p>The staff looked surprised. So I asked it again.</p>

<p>"What.. Why?"</p>

<p>"It's an assignment of my business course."</p>

<p>"Well... do you have a loyalty card or ...? "</p>

<p>"No. I just want to get 10% off."</p>

<p>"Sorry, no..."</p>

<p>Failed as imagined. But I felt good.</p>

<p>I usually don't take the first step out. I lived in fear of failure, rejection, being embarrassed in public...</p>

<p>When I looked back, I thought it wasn't a big deal. I saw a lot of people asking for discount or other ridiculous requests.</p>

<p>But the failure today means a lot to me, a least I tried, and I am prepared to fail again.</p>

description: Build a cracker jokes web application for Christmas.
---

I spent few hours on building [__Cracker Jokes__](http://crackerjokes.herokuapp.com/) -- A Web Application based on _Ruby_ and _Sinatra_.

I have little knowledge of Christmas. Sleeping and eating instant noodles was the theme of last few Christmas. This year, however, I am invited to a Christmas party. Apart from chosing the gifts, I also got to know some more about Christmas tradition. 

Craker Jokes is one of them. I have seen it few times on UK films and also inside Tescos. So I came up with the idea -- backing up some _cracker jokes_ for the party. 

I decide to use Ruby and Sinatra to realize it. Since I built a similar web app last summer, I set up this app quickly. 

The feature is quite simple, pop up a joke and click to see the next. [Click here and have fun!](http://crackerjokes.herokuapp.com/) Suggestions are always [_welcome_](https://github.com/lawrencesun/crackerjokes).

_Merry Christmas and Happy New Year_

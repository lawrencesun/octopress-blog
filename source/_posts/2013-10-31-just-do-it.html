<p>When I decided to engage myself to startup, I was not ready for the crucial reality, though I knew over 90% startups failed. Most of the startup stories are about success. Now I prefer the stories about failure.</p>

<p>After getting to know more about lean startup from the LeanConf, I realised I should act, as soon as possible.</p>

<p>One of the major problem is, I always tend to stay in the comfort zone. I dreamed a dream that customers would come to me. So I spent a lot of time to make my figure more shining. I have never met a single customer. I am introverted and don't like to talk a lot with people. But now I know I must get out and talk to customers.</p>

<p>Another problem is, I am not confident enough about the products. I think mobile app for small business is a good idea. Again, since I haven't talk to them, I don't know if it solved their problems.</p>

<p>What I learned from other entrepreneurs is that fail as soon as possible. Otherwise you are killing your time and money.</p>

<p>So I will get out to reach potential customers, and this time I shall set a deadline for myself.</p>

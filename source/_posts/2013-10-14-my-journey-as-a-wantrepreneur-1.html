<p>I liked the word 'wantrepreneur' since I saw it. Briefly speaking, I set up a company this summer. After quitting my full-time job, I finally started my business this month.</p>

<p>All I did in the last two weeks was exactly a wantrepreneur would do. Buying a domain, setting up a website, printing business cards, renting a office(well, I just bought a virtual one coz I didn't get enough money...), preparing keynotes...etc. BUT, I haven't touched a single customer! I was afraid of being turned town, no confidence of my skills and products.</p>

<p>I know many people like myself want to set up own business and live a freedom life. I read the blogs, ebooks of 'How to xxx' all day and all of the night. And, of course, the overnight millionaire stories of start-ups.</p>

<p>I found 'How to make a $1000 a month' on <a href="http://www.appsumo.com" target="_blank">Appsumo</a> few days ago. I was suspicious at first about this kind of 'How to' things and even now. After seeing the reviews and related videos, I thought,  why not have a try. So I joined today.</p>

<p>The first class is to make $1 from friends. I know I could easily get $1 from my parents and roommate friends. I want to do something different. So I posted something like 'I am taking this course and want to make $1 to begin my business. Could you help me out. ' and 'Not scam.' on Facebook and  then left my Paypal Address. I felt nervous and embarrassed, my heart rated up.</p>

<p>10 minutes later, I received a message from my classmate, 'Hi longtime no see.' Well yes, I haven't log in Facebook for ages.</p>

<p>Then I realized I should try other methods. While most of my friends (in China) were in sleep at that time,  I sent a message to one of my close friends in USA. She agreed after my explanation but the problem was that she didn't use Paypal.</p>

<p>Not a victory yet. But I feel good now coz I will ask for money from customers one day.</p>

<p>Updated: here is the money I got, not in my hand though...</p>

<p>Hi, I am Lawrence. This is my personal blog. Lawrence  is my English name... well...one of my English names.</p>

<p>I am a half-blood geek, like to travel the world, eat good food, see nice movies, write blogs...</p>

<p>The main language of this blog is Chinese, although my compatriot may find it difficult to access this site thanks for the 'Great Wall'.</p>

<p>You may see some English posts... more precisely, Chinglish posts. So if you could fully understand what I wrote in these posts, you'd better learn some English.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent few hours on building <a href="http://crackerjokes.herokuapp.com/"><strong>Cracker Jokes</strong></a> &mdash; A Web Application based on <em>Ruby</em> and <em>Sinatra</em>.</p>

<p>I have little knowledge of Christmas. Sleeping and eating instant noodles was the theme of last few Christmas. This year, however, I am invited to a Christmas party. Apart from chosing the gifts, I also got to know some more about Christmas tradition.</p>

<p>Craker Jokes is one of them. I have seen it few times on UK films and also inside Tescos. So I came up with the idea &mdash; backing up some <em>cracker jokes</em> for the party.</p>

<p>I decide to use Ruby and Sinatra to realize it. Since I built a similar web app last summer, I set up this app quickly.</p>

<p>The feature is quite simple, pop up a joke and click to see the next. <a href="http://crackerjokes.herokuapp.com/">Click here and have fun!</a> Suggestions are always <a href="https://github.com/lawrencesun/crackerjokes"><em>welcome</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year</em></p>
